# Vocabulary of Josh Waitzkin

In this project, I scraped three podcast transcripts from the Tim Ferriss Show, seperated the guest's dialogue from the host's, and removed common words to reveal Mr. Waitzkin's nuanced vocabulary.

## Project Goal
As a long time listener of the Tim Ferriss show, I have especially enjoyed episodes where Josh Waitzkin is a guest. Josh Waitzkin was a chess prodigy, martial artist, and the author of one of my favorite books - "the Art of Learning". Mr. Waitzin is a very intelligent and introspective person who has been influenced heavily by asian philosophies. Because of this, he has a very interesting way to talking about things and ideas. I started this project hoping that I could dig into what it is about his language that makes him unique. After web scraping the transcripts I quickly realized that I was in over my head and lacked the background in linguistics needed to conduct the anlaysis that I wanted. Instead, I decided to conduct an audit of sorts on the vocabulary of Mr. Waitzkin as displayed in the three interviews which combined for roughly 3.5 hours of dialogue.
